# CasperBot
<h2>Casper Bot for Discord</h2>
<p> This is a Discord bot using a modified API call to gpt3.5 for a response a Casper the friendly AI.</p>
<p> Populate a .env file with the appropriate keys and casper away! Casper will respond to '!casper' as the prompt prefix. </p>

<p> I will eventually get to adding WhisperAI and a voice synthesization tool to allow Casper to haunt you in your discord calls.</p>
